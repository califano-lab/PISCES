Description: PISCES is the Califano lab pipeline for single-cell RNAseq analysis. It leverages the ARACNe-3 and NaRnEA algorithms to infer regulatory networks and protein activity, with clustering, plotting, and master regulator identification functionality. PISCES can work off of either a Seurat object or in a more independent manner.
